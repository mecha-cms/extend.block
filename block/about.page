Block is a kind of placeholder that can be embedded in the page content which normally can be written like HTML code in general, but with custom enclosing characters. Each block pattern can then be converted into something more complex.

By default, a block syntax can be defined as follow. It uses `‌[‌[‌` and `‌]‌]‌` as the enclosing characters:

 - Void blocks → `‌[‌[block]‌]‌` or `‌[‌[‌block‌/‌]‌]‌`
 - Container blocks → `‌[‌[‌block‌]‌]content[‌[‌/‌block‌]‌]`

Block attribute syntax is the same as the attribute syntax in HTML.

Blocks are configurable. Even, you can specify your own block markup by editing the configuration file. From the position of this file, go to `lot\state\config.php` then look for the `union` part that looks like this:

~~~ .php
1 => [
    0 => ['[‌[‌', '‌]‌]', '‌/‌'],
    1 => ['=', '"', '"', ' '],
    2 => ['[‌[‌!', '!‌]‌]'],
    3 => ['`[‌[‌', '‌]‌]`']
]
~~~

 - The `0` parts are configuration for the block tag.
 - The `1` parts are configuration for the block tag’s attribute.
 - The `2` parts are for the block comment markup.
 - The `3` parts are for the escape marker.

Following is an example of configuring block pattern as regular HTML (custom HTML tags):

~~~ .xmp.txt
<‌block‌>content<‌/‌block‌>
~~~

~~~ .php
1 => [
    0 => ['<‌', '‌>', '‌/‌'],
    1 => ['=', '"', '"', ' '],
    2 => ['<‌!--', '--‌>'],
    3 => ['&lt;', '&gt;']
]
~~~
